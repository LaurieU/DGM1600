Nier Automata is my 2017 GOTY, but Resident Evil 7 was pretty alright too.
I'm also a big fan of Vanillaware titles, the DMC franchise, and the souls series. 
I'm currently playing through Evil Within and Dying Light.
The first games I ever played were Fire Emblem and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories
on the GBA.
